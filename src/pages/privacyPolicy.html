					<h3>1. Your Personal Information.</h3>
					<p>
						This application does not require registration. No personal information is collected, retained, or requested. Location access is not sought.<br/>
						No person from the Publisher or those affiliated with the Conceal Network Project will ever request your data, keys, donations, or information relating
						to your wallet’s security or usage.
					</p>

					<h3>2. Camera</h3>
					<p>
						Your camera will only be used for reading QR codes and only if you choose to use the feature. QR code images are used by the wallet to help import address
						data. This wallet will never retain camera images and only activate your camera upon request.
					</p>

					<h3>3. Private Keys</h3>
					<p>
						Your private key/mnemonic phrase are the only way you can access your coins in the event of losing access to your device. Users are highly encouraged to
						backup and safeguard their key/phrase. The wallet publisher does not have the ability to recover your wallet in the event of a loss or hack.
					</p>

					<h3>4. Blockchain Transactions</h3>
					<p>
						Your transactions made using this wallet are relayed through a decentralized, global computational network. The recipient(s) and amount(s) of the
						transactions are not publicly visible. The wallet’s underlying operation does not take place on a centralized server.<br/>
						In considering this wallet and how transactions are processed, users should understand there is no entity with the ability to revert transactions or
						stop those that are pending. Users should be incredibly detailed when inputting addresses and amounts as once the transaction is authorized, it is final
						in every sense.
					</p>

					<h3>5. Usage Statistics</h3>
					<p>
						As your wallet interactions do not take place on a server, there is no record of your statistics, balances, transactions, nor application activity.
					</p>

					<h3>6. Support Requests</h3>
					<p>
						As a volunteer driven project, there is no group responsible for providing support for the wallet. However, helpful community members will often assist
						others, on their own volition, in a dedicated channel within the Conceal Community. Anyone can join at https://discord.conceal.network
					</p>

					<h3>7. More Info</h3>
					<p>
						This wallet is based on the client side <a href="https://wallet.conceal.network" >wallet.conceal.network</a>. Terms of use and further information can be found there.
						The mobile wallet Publisher is producing this application to the benefit of the Conceal Community. It is completely open source and can be replicated by any project.
