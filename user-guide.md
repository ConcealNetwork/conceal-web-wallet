## FAQ

### Login System
**Q: Why is there no username? Should I use my wallet address?**  
A: The Conceal Web Wallet operates entirely client-side in a serverless environment. This means:
- Your wallet data is stored and encrypted locally in your browser
- There is no server-side login system
- Your wallet address is not used as a username
- The password is used solely to decrypt your local wallet data
- This architecture provides enhanced privacy and security as your data never leaves your device

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warning**: Since your wallet is stored in your browser's local storage, clearing your browser local storage will delete your wallet data. Always ensure you have a backup of your wallet (using the Export feature) before clearing browser data. If you need to clear your browser data, export your wallet first using one of the export methods (PDF, encrypted file, or private keys).

### Multiple Wallets
**Q: Can I switch between multiple wallets?**  
A: Yes! You can manage multiple wallets using the export/import file feature. Remember that the last wallet imported will be the one stored in your browser's local storage.

### Wallet Passwords
**Q: Can I use different passwords for different wallets?**  
A: Yes, and it's recommended for security. However, be cautious with browser password managers as they store passwords based on URLs, not local storage files. This means they might not correctly associate passwords with specific wallets.

### Optimization Issues
**Q: Why doesn't optimization work when the system suggests it?**  
A: While the system may detect that optimization is mathematically possible, the actual optimization process involves random UTXO selection. Sometimes, this selection might not meet the requirements for creating an optimization transaction. This is normal and you can try again later.

### Transaction Failures
**Q: What does a "{status | failed}" message mean?**  
A: This indicates that your transaction was submitted to the network but rejected. Common causes include:
- Some decoy inputs were already spent
- Insufficient funds
- Network congestion

**Solutions:**
1. Try resubmitting the transaction
2. Consider running optimization
3. Wait for network confirmation of pending transactions
4. Check your balance and available funds



### What is the difference between the Web Wallet and the Desktop Wallet?

**Desktop Wallet**
- Can run its own node or connect directly to a node using RPC.
- Stores your wallet data locally on your computer as a `.wallet` file (encrypted or not).
- Offers more advanced features and direct blockchain interaction.

**Web Wallet**
- Runs entirely in your web browser (no installation needed).
- Your wallet data is encrypted and stored locally in your browser, or can be exported as an encrypted `.json` file.
- Connects to Conceal nodes via HTTPS to scan the blockchain and submit transactions.
- Provides a convenient, serverless interface‚Äîyour private data never leaves your device.
- The web wallet at `https://wallet.conceal.network` acts as an online tool provider, not a data host.
