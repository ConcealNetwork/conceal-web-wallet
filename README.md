# Conceal Web Wallet
This web wallet uses serverless technology and does everything on client-side to give the best privacy to its users.

# Security
No keys, seeds, or sensitive data is sent to the server (truly serverless and client-side operated).

Encryption is done with a certified library, [Tweetnacl.Js.](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js).

If you find a potential security issue, please contact us via [Discord] (https://discord.conceal.network) so we can patch it as soon as possible.
